## Goal

You inherit this code base that is used to compute elections results in different ways.

You goal will be to avoid any potential fraud, and add the following features:

- Count as null a vote of an elector in another district
- Make sure nobody can vote twice.

## How you can use this kata

We have found this kata useful to:

- train on refactoring
- play with TCR (we recommand using this [awesome plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7655-limited-wip) for
  IntelliJ
- discuss on tests
- expriment on several designs
